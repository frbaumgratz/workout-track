# Frontend Folder Structure (Nuxt)

This template uses Nuxt 4 with pages/layouts and Tailwind. Variable and function names in English; inline comments in pt-BR.

Project (relevant app directories):

- `app/pages/` — Route-driven pages. Keep page logic simple; move reusable logic to composables or components.
- `app/layouts/` — App layouts (default, auth, etc.).
- `app/components/` — UI components (pure presentation or small logic). Use clear, descriptive names.
- `app/assets/css/main.css` — Tailwind entry and small helpers.
- `app/plugins/` (optional) — Client/server plugins; keep minimal.
- `app/middleware/` (optional) — Route middleware (navigation guards).

Conventions:

- JS SFCs (no TS in components/pages).
- Keep global state in Pinia stores under `stores/` (either `app/stores/` if using srcDir, or root `stores/`).
- Use `useFetch()` to call server endpoints; do not access MongoDB from the client.
- Keep components small; extract repeated UI into base components.
