# Design & Tech Decisions

## Data Storage
- Chose MongoDB for flexibility with tracking different types of exercises
- Data is stored remotely (not localStorage or IndexedDB)

## Auth
- Not included in MVP to keep scope small
- Will consider user accounts once multi-user support is needed

## Mobile Support
- Deferred for now due to lack of need
- Will revisit if user demand arises
